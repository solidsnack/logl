Log\L presents a userless, unauthenticated storage system. Knowing a log or
log entry's UUID is enough information to perform any available operation on
that resource.

This simplifies deployment and management of a Log\L system and, undeniably,
simplifies development. A reliable user authentication database for a system
like Log\L can be far more challenging than Log\L itself. Log\L can be placed
behind an authenticating proxy for authorization and access control; and
setting a notional "account" in a header gives Log\L something to put in its
logs for correlating resources with users in the background.

In this document, we describe a setup for Log\L proxied behind Nginx,
providing authentication and accounting. Note well, though, that nothing in
this setup ensures a user may only access logs they have allocated; as long as
they authenticate, they can access any log they can guess the UUID of. True
access control requires a proxy that understands the request body well enough
to know which resources are being accessed.


The included Nginx config is meant to be run with user-level privileges and
only touches files in the current working directory. To use it, `cd' to the
directory the config file is in and run:

   nginx -p "$(pwd)/" -c ./nginx.conf

This won't work if you try to access the file from some other directory, as
Nginx requires very explicit instruction to find its PID file, logs and so
forth. You may see an error about being unable to open the system error log;
that's okay, the error log is set to a local file after the config is loaded.
