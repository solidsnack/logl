  You need the Haskell platform to work this program. To check that you have
  the appropriate packages available, use cabal:

   :; cabal configure

  It will bail, describing the packages it could not find. You can install
  them with `cabal install'.

  Create databases/accounts with ./walkthrough/connections.sql; for example:

   :; sudo -u postgres psql < ./walkthrough/connections.sql

  The walkthrough demo-server is executable and can find the application code
  as long as you are in the root of the source tree. It has the connection
  parameters hardcoded and will serve on port 3000. To start it, run:

   :; ./walkthrough/server.hs

  Now you can POST a request to allocate a new log:

   :; echo "alloc: { time: '2010-03-02T12:11:10Z', tag: example }" |
      curl --data-binary @- -i --header "Content-Type: application/yaml" \
           http://localhost:3000/interpret
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Tue, 16 Aug 2011 11:05:04 GMT
    Content-Type: application/yaml
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked

    'alloc': '97f5d690-c7f7-11e0-ba9f-575239c08e8c'
